# Read Food Planning Using Integer Programming Report for our write up! (https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQhR-JRxOtbyxbm5cmfZXIffc4XK4m_yKxUHEZw6kI6PoIaje9r4lAJ48nff8-RnuE8Ew2bDSqU1XYt/pub)
# main.py, baseline.py and proportional.py contain our CSP, random allocation, and proportional allocation code, which take in the data from the census (in data folder) and output to respective csv files.
# running evaluation_main.py will display the results of our various models on our evaluation metrics.
# adjacency.json and adjacency.py use the publicly available tract census data to determine which tracts in a certain county are neighbors. This was used for our CSP adjacency constraint.
